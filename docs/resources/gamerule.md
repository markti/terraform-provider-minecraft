# minecraft_gamerule (Resource)

Manage a Minecraft **gamerule** with Terraform.  
Use this to declaratively set world rules like `keepInventory`, `doDaylightCycle`, or `randomTickSpeed`.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Keep inventory after death
resource "minecraft_gamerule" "keep_inventory" {
  name  = "keepInventory"
  value = "true"
}

# Increase random tick speed (plant growth, fire spread)
resource "minecraft_gamerule" "tick_speed" {
  name  = "randomTickSpeed"
  value = "10"
}
```
